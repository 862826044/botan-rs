# botan-src

This crate compiles the sources of the
[Botan](https://botan.randombit.net/) cryptography library as a static
library. It is supposed to be used by the
[botan-sys](https://crates.io/crates/botan-sys) crate.

A high level Rust interface built on this library is included in the
[botan](https://crates.io/crates/botan) crate.
