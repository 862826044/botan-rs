API considerations
----------------------

Some Rust APIs seems to prefer writing to a slice vs returning a Vec
to save an allocation. Worth it?

Currently we only offer one-shot encryption/decryption for symmetric
ciphers. Support incremental update?

Missing Functions
---------------------

These are functions currently exposed by Botan's C API which are not
exposed by the high level Rust wrapper:

botan_pwdhash_timed
botan_privkey_create_dsa
botan_privkey_load_sm2
botan_pubkey_load_sm2
