API considerations
----------------------

Some Rust APIs seems to prefer writing to a slice vs returning a Vec.
Worth it?

Currently we only offer one-shot encryption/decryption for symmetric
ciphers. Support incremental update?

Missing Functions
---------------------

These are functions currently exposed by Botan's C API which are not
exposed by the high level Rust wrapper:

botan_base64_encode
botan_base64_decode

botan_privkey_load_ed25519
botan_pubkey_load_ed25519
botan_privkey_ed25519_get_privkey
botan_pubkey_ed25519_get_pubkey

botan_x509_cert_gen_selfsigned
botan_x509_cert_allowed_usage
botan_x509_cert_verify
botan_x509_cert_validation_status
